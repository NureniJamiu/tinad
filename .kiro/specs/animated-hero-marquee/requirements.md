# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds an animated marquee section to the Hero component with continuously moving elements including scrolling text, a rotating music disc, and an animated music wave visualization. The animations create an immersive, dynamic experience that reinforces the music label's brand identity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Continuous Horizontal Text Marquee

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see the "This is Not a Drill" text continuously scrolling horizontally across the screen, so that I experience a dynamic and engaging visual effect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section loads THEN the text "This is Not a Drill" SHALL appear and begin scrolling from right to left
2. WHEN the text exits the left side of the viewport THEN it SHALL seamlessly reappear on the right side without any visible gap or jump
3. WHEN the animation is running THEN the text SHALL maintain a smooth, consistent speed throughout
4. WHEN viewed on any screen size THEN the marquee SHALL fill the viewport width and scroll continuously
5. WHEN multiple instances of the text are needed for seamless looping THEN they SHALL be rendered to ensure no gaps appear during scrolling

### Requirement 2: Rotating Music Disc Animation

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see a music disc rotating continuously in a clockwise direction, so that I experience a visual representation of music playing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section loads THEN the music disc image (music-disc.png) SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN the disc is visible THEN it SHALL rotate continuously in a clockwise direction
3. WHEN the rotation animation runs THEN it SHALL maintain a smooth, constant rotation speed
4. WHEN the page remains open THEN the disc SHALL continue rotating indefinitely without stopping
5. WHEN the disc completes a full 360-degree rotation THEN it SHALL seamlessly continue rotating without any pause or jump

### Requirement 3: Animated Music Wave Visualization

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see an animated music wave visualization, so that I experience a dynamic representation of sound waves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section loads THEN a music wave visualization SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN the static music-wave.png image is insufficient for animation THEN an alternative implementation (CSS animation, SVG, or canvas) SHALL be used to create moving wave effects
3. WHEN the wave animation runs THEN it SHALL create the visual impression of sound waves moving or pulsing
4. WHEN the animation plays THEN it SHALL loop continuously and smoothly
5. WHEN viewed alongside the disc THEN the wave animation SHALL complement the disc rotation visually

### Requirement 4: GSAP-Powered Animations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all animations to be implemented using GSAP, so that we maintain consistency with the existing animation approach and leverage GSAP's performance benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the marquee text animation THEN GSAP SHALL be used for the horizontal scrolling motion
2. WHEN implementing the disc rotation THEN GSAP SHALL be used for the continuous rotation animation
3. WHEN implementing the wave animation THEN GSAP SHALL be used if applicable for the animation technique chosen
4. WHEN animations are initialized THEN they SHALL use GSAP's timeline or tween methods appropriately
5. WHEN the component unmounts THEN GSAP animations SHALL be properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 5: Component-Based Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the animated elements to be organized as reusable components, so that the code is maintainable and follows React best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the marquee text THEN it SHALL be created as a separate component (e.g., MarqueeText)
2. WHEN implementing the disc animation THEN it SHALL be created as a separate component (e.g., RotatingDisc)
3. WHEN implementing the wave animation THEN it SHALL be created as a separate component (e.g., MusicWave)
4. WHEN these components are created THEN they SHALL be imported and used within the Hero component
5. WHEN components are structured THEN they SHALL accept props for customization where appropriate (e.g., text content, animation speed)

### Requirement 6: Responsive Layout and Visibility

**User Story:** As a visitor on any device, I want the animated elements to be properly visible and positioned within the viewport, so that I can see the complete visual experience regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN all animated elements SHALL be visible within the viewport without requiring scrolling
2. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt to ensure elements remain visible and properly sized
3. WHEN the marquee text is displayed THEN it SHALL use appropriate font sizing that matches the design (approximately 190px on desktop)
4. WHEN the disc and wave are positioned THEN they SHALL be placed according to the design layout shown in the reference screenshot
5. WHEN elements overlap or layer THEN proper z-index values SHALL be applied to maintain the intended visual hierarchy
