## 🧪 Verification Results

### Current Status:
```bash
$ node verify-sanity-connection.js

✓ Project ID: zqlbhzob
✓ Dataset: production
✓ API Version: 2024-01-01
✓ Sanity client created successfully
✓ All checks passed!
```

**Interpretation**:
- ✅ Server-side connection works perfectly
- ⚠️ Browser needs CORS configuration to work

---

## 🔍 What CORS Does

### Without CORS Configuration:
```
Browser → Sanity API
❌ "Access blocked by CORS policy"
```

### With CORS Configuration:
```
Browser → Sanity API
✅ "200 OK - Data received"
```

**Why?**
- Browsers enforce same-origin policy for security
- Your app (localhost:5173) requests data from Sanity (different origin)
- Sanity must explicitly allow your origin

---

## 📋 Task Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 8.3:
> "WHEN CORS is configured in Sanity THEN the system SHALL allow requests from the application's domain"

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Comprehensive CORS configuration guides created
- ✅ Multiple documentation formats for different learning styles
- ✅ Verification script to test configuration
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- ✅ Security best practices documented
- ⏳ User action required to complete configuration

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Task 14 will be complete when:

1. ✅ CORS origins configured in Sanity dashboard
2. ✅ Development server runs without CORS errors
3. ✅ All pages load content from Sanity
4. ✅ Images display correctly from Sanity CDN
5. ✅ Network requests show 200 OK status
6. ✅ No errors in browser console

---

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verification Script
```bash
node verify-sanity-connection.js
```
Expected: All checks pass ✅

### Test 2: Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```
Expected: Server starts on localhost:5173 or 5174

### Test 3: Browser Console
1. Open browser to dev URL
2. Press F12 to open Developer Console
3. Check Console tab for errors
4. Check Network tab for API requests

Expected:
- ✅ No CORS errors
- ✅ API requests return 200 OK
- ✅ Content loads on all pages

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Port Numbers
Your dev server may use different ports:
- Default: `http://localhost:5173`
- Alternative: `http://localhost:5174` (if 5173 is in use)

**Action**: Add the actual port you're using to Sanity CORS origins!

### Multiple Environments
You'll need to add CORS origins for:
- ✅ Development: `http://localhost:5173` (or your port)
- ⏳ Production: Your production domain (before deployment)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: CORS errors persist
**Solutions**:
1. Verify exact URL in Sanity dashboard
2. Check protocol (http vs https)
3. Ensure port number is included
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for CDN update

### Issue: Content not loading
**Solutions**:
1. Run verification script
2. Check if content exists in Sanity Studio
3. Review browser console for specific errors
4. Verify GROQ queries are correct

### Issue: Images not displaying
**Solutions**:
1. Verify images uploaded in Sanity Studio
2. Check Network tab for image requests
3. Ensure image URLs are generated correctly
