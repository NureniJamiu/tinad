## How to Use These Images

### Option 1: Upload to Sanity (Recommended)
1. Download these images from your /public folder
2. Upload them through Sanity Studio interface
3. This ensures they're served through Sanity's CDN with optimization

### Option 2: Reference Locally (Not Recommended)
- These images are currently in your local /public folder
- They won't be available through Sanity's CDN
- Better to upload them to Sanity for consistency

## Image Quality Note

These existing images appear to be placeholder or demo images. For a professional production site, consider:
- Using high-quality stock photos from Unsplash/Pexels
- Ensuring consistent style and quality across all images
- Using actual artist/producer photos if available

## Recommendation

While these images exist, I recommend:
1. **For quick testing:** Use these images to populate Sanity quickly
2. **For production:** Replace with high-quality, professional images from stock photo sites or actual artist photos

This will ensure:
- Better image quality
- Consistent styling
- Professional appearance
- Proper CDN optimization through Sanity
